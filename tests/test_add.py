    Load test molecules from the Chemical Components Dictionary (CCD),
    subject AtomArray to rotation and translation by a
    randomly chosen degree respectively distance, extract hydrogen
    coordinates and remove hydrogen.
    Then, the `add_hydrogen` function is applied and it is verified
    whether the coordinates of the newly added hydrogen atoms are in
    accordance with the original coordinates within an appropriate
    tolerance range.
    Rotation and translation of the primary AtomArray from the CCD by
    randomly chosen values is performed for two reasons:
    On the one hand, the AtomArrays from the CCD themselves serve as
    reference for hydrogen addition. Hence, AtomArrays loaded from the
    CCD without any further spatial modification possess exactly the
    same coordinates as the reference array, which is regularly not the
    case with residues the user obtained e. g. from a molecular dynamics
    simulation or x-ray cristallography. This implies that the
    implementation's capacity to rotate the two molecules once they are
    centered such that congruence is achieved between them to a
    satisfying extent is crucial. Therefore, the need for congruence by
    rotation is artificially created.
    On the other hand, a fragment consisting of at least three atoms is
    required in order to definitely determine the position of hydrogen
    to add as three points create a plane and a fragment consisting
    e. g. of only two atoms leaves a rotational degree of freedom that
    makes it impossible to reproduce the original positions of the
    hydrogen atoms. In biomolecules, this scenario is commonly
    encountered in terminal amino groups or methyl groups or terminal
    groups in general. Proper conformation of hydrogen bound to terminal
    groups with rotational freedom however is tested in the test
    belonging to the relaxation function.
    For this reason, only molecules enabling the construction of
    fragments with at least three atoms such as aromatic or cyclic
    compounds are chosen in this test.
